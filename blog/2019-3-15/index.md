##### Individually I was able to complete a lot of the small details this weeks. Lots of little bug fixes too. Snackbars were the big thing I implemented this week. Snackbars are used to let the user know when they've done an action, an action that doesn't require further instructions. So you'd use a snackbar if a user has just sumbitted a new post. You'd probably want to use a pop-up modal, as opposed to a snackbar, if you were doing a delete however, to make sure the user really wanted to delete.

##### QUESTION: As a part of your journal entry, write ¼ to ½ a page reflecting on your experiences working with a team to bring an application to completion.
##### Final completion is much easier said than done. Final completion means a user can use the app and, no bugs, issues, it works perfect first time. To get to that level really does take an eye for details and truly understanding the ENTIRE codebase.

### Detailed Analysis
Ticket 1 - finished snackbars

  * This week one of my main focuses was on little features, the main one being snackbars. They add a nice subtle touch to the UI and let the user know how they're doing. Using google's material-ui, I implemented a variety of different styled-snackbars across the site. It subtle but really adds to the overall feel.
